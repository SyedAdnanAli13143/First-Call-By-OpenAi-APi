# First-Call-By-OpenAi-APi

🚀 Getting Started with OpenAI + Python (Jupyter / Cursor)

I’ve set up a clean starter workflow for working with OpenAI models in Python using Cursor / Jupyter notebooks and environment-based configuration.

🔹 What this setup covers:

Python & Jupyter extensions in Cursor

Virtual environment support (uv / .venv)

Secure API key loading via .env

Simple OpenAI client initialization

First successful call to a GPT-5 model (gpt-5-nano)

This makes it easy to quickly prototype, test prompts, and build AI-powered features in a reproducible way.

📌 Ideal for:

AI prototyping

Learning OpenAI APIs

Document processing & automation workflows
